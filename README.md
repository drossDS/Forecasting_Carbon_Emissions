# Forecasting Carbon Emissions
***Using Timeseries Regression Techniques to Predict Greenhouse Gas Emissions***

## Background and Problem Statement
Global warming presents a major challenge to humanity, and in an effort to quantify and forecast it's impacts, greenhouse gas emmissions predictions would be a reuqired input.  Timeseries data were provided for monthly greenhouse gas emmissions from a vareity of fuel sources used for electric energy production in the United States from 1973 to 2016.  The fuel soureces include natural gas, coal, and petroleum among others.  The goal of this project focused on forecasting the carbon diaoxide (CO2) emmisions from electric energy production fueld by natural gas for 12 months beyond the provided data.

## Initial Processing
As the emissions data included a vareity of sources, the natural gas data needed to be extracted into its own data frame for cleaning and pre-processing.  Note, while the attached code will show that all emissions data for the various fuels were plotted, this report will only consider the natural gas emmissions data as they were only emissions this project was tasked with forecasting.  After dropping unecesasry columns, the time data was converted from an integer object to a proper date-time format.  This step revealed that the time data contained a null value between every twleve-month interval, which was quickly determined to coincide with a twelve-month (yearly) emissions sum.  The data corresponding to these null time values were removed as they are not part of a proper timeseries and of no use in forcasting.  A plot of the cleaned natural gas emissions data is plotted below (left).

From the plot, a distinct upward trend in natural gas emmissions can be observed from around 1990 onward that is inconsistent with the previous 17 years of data.  It further appears that this trend is maintained through the end of the data.  It is unknown what caused this to occur, however, it can be speculated the data prior to this event would not be relevent to a forecasting model for a time period beyond the provided data.  Thus, the data used for model fiting and forecasting was taken from 1990 onward (see right plot above).

## Exploraoty Data Analaysis
Exploratory data analyssios focused primarily on determining the stationarity of the data and examining its seasonal properties.  Visually, the emissions data are clearly not stationary, which is a general requirement for timeseries regression models.  However, it was determined from some initial model fits that non-stationary data provided much better results (to be discussed later in *Training Data Processing*). The seasonal properties of the data are also visually apparent from the regular 12-month preiod of oscilation corresponding to the cyclical nature of energy demand throughout the year in the United States.  Both the stationarity and seasonlity were examined using a "seasonal_decompose" function to decompose the emissions dataset their trend, seasonality, and residuual components.  The results are provided below, showing the isolated upward trend in emissions, and a 12-month seasonal period.

Also included in the exploratory data analsysis was the plotting of Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Functions (ACF) and PACF), and whiel the intent was to inform the hyperparameter selection process for the regression models, the results did not prove to be useful in model optimization process.

## Summary of Model Development Process
The forecasting model development process is described below and presented graphically with the provided flowcharts.  More detailed descriptions are provided in the dropdown menu below the images.
- It was determined during initial evaltuations that the selected transofrmation for the training data affected the error of the predictions.  Thus four datasets with different transformations were created
- Each of the four datasets was then used to train four varieties of non-seasonal models each optimized against 13 hyperparameter combinations for a grand total of 208 non-seasonal model combinations evaluated.  The best non-seasonal model was identified to be the combination with the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of its emissions predictions versus the input emissions data
- An "auto_arima" function with built-in optimization was run against the best two performing datasets from the non-seasonal models ("Raw Data" and "Log Data"), and the funciton output two corresponding best-performing models based on the AIC metric
- A final hybridized-parameter seasonal model was created combining the best performing dataset, and hyperparameters across all models

- A validation dataset was then crated from the last 12 months of the provided emisions data.  All four models were then used to forecast the emissions during this period using five subsets of the remainign emissions data to create training datasets of five different timespans from the prior 25 years, 10 years, 79 months, 67 months, and 55 months of emissions data.  THe forecasting errors were then calcualted for each of the 20 model and timespan combinations to select the final model

### Training Data Processing
The general rule is that the training data used to fit regression models must be stationary for the model to make a proper prediction.  However, it was determined during initial investiagtions that the non-sationary data actually produced the lowest-error predictions.  From this, four input datasets were created with various combinations of transformations to be run through all models (explained in further detail below) so that the datasets could be compared and the best tranformation method(s) selected.
- ***Raw Data***:  Untransformed natural gas emissions data in its "raw" form after having been cleaned and formatted as described previously
- ***Log Data***:  The Raw Data with a log transformation, attmepting to achieve stationarity
- ***Shifted Data***:  Raw Data which has been "shifted" by taking the difference between successive data point; effectively, the derivative of the dataset
- ***Log Shifted Data***:  Log-transformed Raw Data which was then "shifted" as described above
Of the four datasets above, only "shifted" datasets acheived stationarity as determined by an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.  As stated previously, stationarity had a negative impact on the model performacne as will be explained in the next section.

### Fitting and Optimizing Non-Seasonal Regression Models
Four model varieties were created including:
- Autoregressive (AR) Models
- Moving Average (MA) Models
- Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Models
- Autoregressive Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) Models

Each of these four models were trained against all four datasets above creating a combination of 16 model-dataset combinations.  Additionally, the p and q hyperparameters present in each of these model combinations were swepth through the values 0 through 12 with p and q being equal in all cases to limit computation time by limiting total hyperparameter combinations to just 13.  Thus, each of the 16 model-dataset combinations was run with hyperparameters p and q set equal through the values 0 - 12 for a grand total of 208 individual model-dataset-hyperparameter combinations.   Each combination was fit to the input training datasets, and their predictions were compared against the actaul emissions from the training data time period (1990 onward), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values were calculated for each model, and are shown in hte dropdown below.  
From error outputs, two important conclusions can be drawn:
- Both shifted datasets produced much higher-error predictions, and thus the non-stationary datasets were providing much better predictions
- The model with the lowest error was an ARIMA model accepting the log-transformed data ("Log Data") with p = q = 10

### Fitting and Optimizing Seasonal Models
Using the auto_arima function from pmdarima, Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models were created and optimized within the function, and the best performing model was output (as evaluated aginst AIC values).  From the above conclusion around stationarity data, auto_arima was only run with the raw and log-transformed datasets.  Within this function, the starting and maximum hyperparaemeter values can be selected and the model will run with each hyperparameter combintaion within the starting to maximum ranges.  After some trail-and-error, it was determined that non-seasonal hyperparaemters p and q would be run between the values 0 and 4 as ranges larger than this were prohibatively time-intensive.  The best model parameters for each dataset were then output and the RMSE values of their predictions against the training data were calcualted in the dame fashion as the non-seasonal models.  In an attemtp to create an even more accurate model, a final model was then speficied combining the parameters from the best seasonal and non-seasonal models.  The RMSE values and parameters for all 4 models are shown in the table below with all non-seasonal (p, d, q) and seasonal (P, D, Q, M) hyperparameters listed:

| Model Name | Type | Input Dataset | *p* | *d* | *q* | *P* | *D* | *Q* | *M* | RMSE |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:  |
| ARIMA_logdata| ARIMA | Log Data   | 10  |  1  | 10  | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 2.2299|
| SARIMA_data| SARIMA | Raw Data    | 1   |  1  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 12 | 2.2591 |
| SARIMA_logdata| SARIMA | Log Data    | 3   |  1  | 4  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 12 | 2.5107 |
| SARIMA_data_1010| SARIMA | Raw Data    | 10  |  1  | 10 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 12 | 2.1682 |

*Table Notes:
- N/A values indicate that the seasonal parameters were not inputs for the non-searonal ARIMA model
- Values for *d* and *D* were set to 1 to indicate that the models were integrating
- Values for *M* were set to 12 as the seasonal models require the period of seasonality as an input
- Exploring additional vlaues for *d*, *D*, and *M* was not considered due to time limitations

A comparison of the preductions from each model to the actual training emissions data are plotted below:

### Trianing Data Timespan and Final Model Selection
For timeseries data, the most recent data has often have the greatesst impact on the model forecasts as much older data may be far less relevant to current trends and negatively impact model acuracy. Thus evaluating the effects of the training data's starting point on the prediction accuracy was required to determine the proper timespan of data against which the model should be trained.  

The training data used previously were split into a validation (test) dataset which contained the most recent 12 months of emissions data (Aug-2015 - Jul-2016), and five different training data subsets with different timespans.  Each of the four models above was then fitted against the five training data subsets, and used to forecast the most recent 12 months of emissions data (Aug-2015 - Jul-2016).  The root mean sqaure error between the forecasted emissions and the actual emissions (validation dataset) were then calcaulated for each model-timespan combination to determine which produced the most acurate forecasts.  The model-timespan combination with the lowest RMSE value was found to be the "SARIMA_logdata" model with the 67 month training data timespan.  Its Mean Average Percent Error (MAPE) against the validation dataset was calculated. The error and forecast of the final model are shown in the plot below:

![](Emissions_Images/Final_Model_Forecast_vs_Validation.png)

Based on the validation dataset, the predicted model error that would be observed aginst the test data is approximately 3%.

## Forecasting Beyond the Provided Data
With final model variety, training data transformation technique, training data timespan, and hyperparaemters selected, the natural gas emssions were forecasted 12 months beyond the provided data.  A final traiing dataset was crteated from the most recent __ months of the provided emissions data and the forecasted carbone emissions are shown in the plot below.

## Conclusions:
The conclusoins of this report are outlined as follows:
- A vareity of seasonal and non-seasonal regression models were used optimized in combination with the transformation methods of the training data
- The four best models based on root mean sqaure error were then selected to be further evaluated based on their ability to forecast the last year of the prodived emisions data
- The effects of five training data timespans on each of the four best models were examined to determine which model and timespan combination produced a forecast with the lowest error
- The best combination with the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was selected and determined to have Mean Avergae Percent Error (MAPE) of approximately 3% when forecasting the last 12 months of provided emissions data
- THe best model was a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrating Moving Average (SARIMA) model trained against the most recent 67 months of log-transformed emissions data
- The final model was then employed to forecast the carbon emissions from natural gas electric energy production 12 motnhs beyond the provided emissions data
